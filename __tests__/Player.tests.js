// ** Note
/* Did you notice that we create a new Player instance in every test? We could choose to use the same one in all of our tests, but this might lead to unintended consequences. Now that our tests affect the Player object's property values, if we used the same object every time, we would no longer be testing properties and methods in isolation.

The moral of the story is that it's important to create a new instance of the object we're testing in every test to give that test a fresh start. */
